# Learn JavaScript in 2024: Complete Roadmap from Zero to Job-Ready

**Last updated: December 20, 2024**

JavaScript is still the most practical first programming language to learn in 2024. Not because it's perfect (it's definitely not), but because it's everywhere: browsers, servers, mobile apps, desktop applications, and even IoT devices. Learn JavaScript well, and you've unlocked access to virtually every programming domain.

This roadmap is brutally honest about timelines, prerequisites, and what "job-ready" actually means. No false promises. No "learn in 30 days" nonsense. Just a realistic path from zero to employable.

## Prerequisites (Don't Skip This)

### 1. Typing Speed: 40+ WPM

Not negotiable. If you're hunting-and-pecking, learning to code will be miserable. Spend 2-4 weeks building typing speed first.

**Resources:**
- [BrokeCoder](#/play) - Practice typing real code patterns through gameplay
- [Master Typing Speed for Coding](#/blog/master-typing-speed-for-coding)
- [Touch Typing for Programmers](#/skills/touch-typing-programmers)

### 2. Basic HTML/CSS Literacy

You don't need to be an expert, but you should understand:
- What HTML tags do
- How CSS selectors work
- The box model basics
- Flexbox/Grid fundamentals

**Time investment:** 2-3 weeks if starting fresh. Learn more in our [HTML/CSS Fundamentals](#/skills/html-css-fundamentals) guide.

### 3. English Reading Comprehension

Documentation, Stack Overflow, and tutorials are in English. If you're not comfortable reading technical English, you'll struggle.

### 4. A Growth Mindset

Learning to code is frustrating. You'll feel stupid daily. That's normal. The difference between successful learners and dropouts is accepting discomfort as part of growth.

## The Timeline (Realistic Numbers)

**Full-time learning (6-8 hours/day):**
- Job-ready basics: 3-4 months
- Portfolio-ready: 5-6 months
- First job offer: 6-12 months (including job search)

**Part-time learning (2-3 hours/day):**
- Job-ready basics: 6-9 months
- Portfolio-ready: 10-14 months
- First job offer: 12-24 months (including job search)

These numbers assume:
- Consistent daily practice
- Building actual projects (not just tutorials)
- Active job searching in final months
- You're in a market with tech jobs
- No major gaps or interruptions

⚠️ **WARNING:** If someone promises you'll be job-ready in 60 days, they're lying or selling something (usually both).

## Phase 1: JavaScript Fundamentals (Weeks 1-6)

### Week 1-2: Syntax and Basic Concepts

**Learn:**
- Variables (let, const, var)
- Data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, array)
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Conditionals (if/else, ternary, switch)
- Loops (for, while, for...of)

**Practice:**
- FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms section
- 50 Codewars 8kyu problems
- [BrokeCoder](#/play) early missions (flip phone era)

**Projects:**
- Calculator
- Number guessing game
- Basic quiz app

**Red flags you're falling behind:**
- Still Googling basic syntax after 2 weeks
- Can't write a for loop without looking it up
- Confusing = and ===

### Week 3-4: Functions and Scope

**Learn:**
- Function declarations vs expressions
- Arrow functions
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Scope (global, function, block)
- Closures (basic understanding)

**Practice:**
- 30 Codewars 7kyu problems
- Refactor previous projects using functions

**Projects:**
- Temperature converter (functions)
- Tip calculator
- Simple text formatter

**Checkpoint:** Can you write a function that takes parameters, does logic, and returns a result without Googling? If no, slow down.

### Week 5-6: Arrays and Objects

**Learn:**
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, find, some, every)
- Array manipulation (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice)
- Object creation and access
- Object methods
- Destructuring
- Spread operator

**Practice:**
- 30 Codewars 7kyu problems focusing on arrays/objects
- [JavaScript Fundamentals skill path](#/skills/javascript-fundamentals)

**Projects:**
- Todo list (array manipulation)
- Contact manager (objects)
- Shopping cart calculator

**Checkpoint:** Can you manipulate arrays and objects confidently? Map/filter/reduce should feel natural, not magical.

## Phase 2: DOM Manipulation and Async (Weeks 7-10)

### Week 7-8: The Document Object Model

**Learn:**
- Selecting elements (querySelector, querySelectorAll)
- Creating and removing elements
- Modifying content and attributes
- Event listeners
- Event delegation
- Forms and input handling

**Practice:**
- Build 5 interactive mini-apps
- [BrokeCoder](#/play) smartphone challenges

**Projects:**
- Interactive todo list (with UI)
- Modal/popup system
- Form validation
- Image gallery with filters

### Week 9-10: Asynchronous JavaScript

**Learn:**
- Callbacks (and callback hell)
- Promises
- Async/await
- Fetch API
- Error handling (try/catch)
- JSON parsing

**Practice:**
- Build apps that fetch real data
- Handle loading states and errors

**Projects:**
- Weather app (OpenWeather API)
- Random user generator (randomuser.me API)
- GitHub profile viewer

**Checkpoint:** Can you fetch data from an API, handle errors, and display results? This is crucial for real jobs.

## Phase 3: Modern JavaScript and Tools (Weeks 11-14)

### Week 11-12: ES6+ Features and Module System

**Learn:**
- Template literals
- Optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Classes (basic)
- Modules (import/export)
- Default parameters
- Rest/spread with objects

**Practice:**
- Refactor previous projects using modern syntax
- Build modular applications

**Projects:**
- Multi-file application
- Reusable component library
- Settings/config system

### Week 13-14: Build Tools and Package Management

**Learn:**
- NPM basics (install, update, scripts)
- Basic Webpack or Vite
- Git and GitHub (version control basics)
- Markdown for documentation

**Practice:**
- Set up projects from scratch
- Push code to GitHub
- Write README files

**Projects:**
- Set up a build pipeline
- Create GitHub Pages site
- Contribute to open source (documentation fix)

**Checkpoint:** Can you initialize a project, install packages, and deploy something basic? This is table stakes for interviews.

## Phase 4: Framework Introduction (Weeks 15-20)

### Choose One Framework (Recommended: React)

**Why React:**
- Highest job demand
- Massive ecosystem
- Strong community
- Transfers to React Native (mobile)

**Alternatives:**
- Vue: Easier learning curve, great docs
- Svelte: Modern, fast, fun
- Angular: Enterprise-heavy, steeper curve

**Don't learn multiple frameworks simultaneously.** Master one first. See our [React Development](#/skills/react-development) guide for details.

### React Learning Path

**Week 15-16: Core Concepts**
- JSX
- Components (functional)
- Props
- State (useState)
- Lists and keys
- Conditional rendering

**Week 17-18: Hooks and Effects**
- useEffect
- useRef
- Custom hooks
- Rules of hooks
- Common patterns

**Week 19-20: Routing and State Management**
- React Router
- Context API
- Prop drilling solutions
- Basic state management patterns

**Projects:**
- Multi-page portfolio site
- CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Dashboard with routing

**Checkpoint:** Can you build a multi-page React app with state management? This is minimum for React jobs.

## Phase 5: Portfolio and Job Prep (Weeks 21-26)

### Build 3-5 Portfolio Projects

**Project Requirements:**
1. **Solves a real problem** (not another todo list)
2. **Uses modern stack** (React + API or similar)
3. **Deployed and live** (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
4. **Clean code** (readable, commented, organized)
5. **Good README** (screenshots, setup instructions, tech stack)

**Project Ideas:**
- Budget tracker with charts
- Recipe finder with filters
- Workout planner
- Book recommendation engine
- Local business directory

**Avoid:**
- Clone apps (Netflix clone, Twitter clone)
- Tutorial projects with minor changes
- Over-complicated megaprojects you'll never finish

Read our complete [Developer Portfolio Guide](#/blog/developer-portfolio-guide) for detailed advice.

### Interview Preparation

**Technical:**
- 50 LeetCode Easy problems
- 10 LeetCode Medium problems (arrays/strings focus)
- System design basics (for mid-level roles)

**Behavioral:**
- Prepare STAR stories
- Practice explaining your projects
- Research companies you're applying to

**Practical:**
- Mock interviews
- Code review practice
- Whiteboard practice

### Resume and Applications

**Resume essentials:**
- Projects section (most important)
- Skills section (honest, no padding)
- Brief education section
- Optional: relevant experience (even non-tech)

**Application strategy:**
- Apply to 10-20 jobs per week
- Customize resume for each role
- Network on LinkedIn and Twitter
- Attend meetups and conferences

**Expected timeline to first offer:**
- 3-6 months of applications
- 50-100+ applications
- 5-10 phone screens
- 2-5 technical interviews
- 1-3 final rounds
- 1 offer (if you're good and persistent)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Tutorial Hell

**Symptom:** You've watched 40 hours of tutorials but can't build anything alone.

**Fix:** After every tutorial, build something similar WITHOUT following along. If you can't, the tutorial moved too fast.

### Perfectionism

**Symptom:** You restart projects constantly, never finishing because they're "not good enough."

**Fix:** Ship ugly, working code. You can always refactor. Perfect is the enemy of done.

### Tool Obsession

**Symptom:** You spend more time configuring Webpack than writing code.

**Fix:** Use Create React App or Vite. You can learn build tools after you have a job.

### Imposter Syndrome

**Symptom:** You feel like a fraud even though you're making progress.

**Fix:** Everyone feels this. Even senior developers Google basic syntax. Focus on growth, not mastery. Read about [avoiding developer burnout](#/blog/avoid-developer-burnout).

### Isolated Learning

**Symptom:** You never show your code to anyone, never ask for help.

**Fix:** Join Discord servers, post on Twitter, do code reviews. Community accelerates learning.

## How to Know You're Ready to Apply

You're ready when you can **confidently** answer yes to:

✅ Can I build a CRUD app with React (or your framework)?
✅ Can I fetch data from an API and handle errors?
✅ Can I explain my code to someone else?
✅ Do I have 3+ projects deployed and on GitHub?
✅ Can I solve LeetCode Easy problems?
✅ Do I understand Git basics (commit, push, pull, merge)?
✅ Can I write a decent README?
✅ Am I comfortable being uncomfortable (asking questions, debugging)?

**You don't need:**
- 🚫 To know everything about JavaScript
- 🚫 To be an algorithms expert
- 🚫 To have a CS degree
- 🚫 To feel "ready" (you never will)

## Resources by Learning Style

### Visual Learners
- Traversy Media (YouTube)
- The Net Ninja (YouTube)
- Scrimba (interactive)

### Reading Learners
- MDN Web Docs (reference)
- JavaScript.info (tutorial)
- Eloquent JavaScript (book)

## The Honest Truth About Self-Teaching

**Advantages:**
- Learn at your own pace
- Save $10k-$20k (vs. bootcamp)
- Build self-directed learning skills
- No time pressure

**Disadvantages:**
- No built-in accountability
- Harder to know what to learn
- No career services
- More isolated
- Longer timeline (usually)

For a detailed comparison, see [Bootcamp vs. Self-Taught](#/blog/bootcamp-vs-self-taught).

**Success factors:**
- Discipline (daily practice)
- Community (Discord, Twitter, meetups)
- Realistic timeline expectations
- Financial runway (6-12 months savings)

## What Comes Next

After landing your first job, check out our [First 90 Days as a Junior Developer](#/blog/first-90-days-junior-developer) guide.

**Year 1:** Learn the codebase, ship features, don't break production
**Year 2:** Mentor juniors, own larger features, improve skills
**Year 3+:** Specialize or go generalist, consider promotion/job hop

**Skill progression:**
- [TypeScript](#/skills/typescript-fundamentals)
- [Testing](#/skills/testing-jest-react)
- [Backend basics](#/skills/nodejs-express)
- [Database fundamentals](#/skills/sql-basics)

**Career paths:**
- [Frontend Developer](#/careers/frontend-developer)
- [Full Stack Developer](#/careers/full-stack-developer)
- [Backend Developer](#/careers/backend-developer)

## Final Thoughts

Learning JavaScript is a marathon, not a sprint. The developers who succeed aren't the smartest—they're the most persistent.

**Realistic expectations:**
- 6-12 months to job-ready (full-time effort)
- 12-24 months (part-time effort)
- Expect to feel lost often
- Expect to relearn concepts multiple times
- Expect job search to be harder than learning

**But here's the good news:** Every employed developer started exactly where you are now. The difference between them and you is just time + practice.

Start today. Build something small. [Practice typing real code patterns](#/play). Repeat daily. In 6 months, you'll be amazed at how far you've come.

# The Complete Developer Productivity Guide: Work Smarter, Not Harder

**Last updated: December 20, 2024**

Productivity isn't about working longer hours—it's about making the hours you work count. The difference between a highly productive developer and an average one isn't talent or experience; it's habits, systems, and knowing when (and when not) to optimize.

This guide covers scientifically-backed strategies that actually work, not productivity theater that just makes you look busy.

## The Productivity Paradox

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **most productivity advice makes you less productive.**

Why? Because it focuses on tools and hacks instead of fundamentals. No Pomodoro timer will help if you're working on the wrong problem. No keyboard shortcut will save you from poorly scoped tasks.

Real productivity comes from:
1. **Clarity** - Knowing what to work on
2. **Focus** - Actually working on it
3. **Energy management** - Sustaining effort over time
4. **Systems** - Making the right thing easy

## Part 1: Deep Work for Developers

### What is Deep Work?

Deep work is focused, uninterrupted time on cognitively demanding tasks. For developers, this means:
- Writing complex algorithms
- Debugging mysterious bugs
- Architecting systems
- Learning new technologies

**The problem:** The average developer gets less than 2 hours of deep work per day. The rest is meetings, Slack, emails, and context switching.

**The opportunity:** Increasing deep work from 2 to 4 hours per day can double your output. Not 20% better—200% better.

### How to Create Deep Work Blocks

**1. Time Block Your Calendar**

- Block 2-4 hour chunks for deep work
- Mark as "Busy" or "Focus Time"
- Treat like important meetings (don't cancel)
- Schedule during your peak energy hours

**2. Eliminate Distractions**

Before your deep work block:
- Close email and Slack (seriously)
- Turn off phone notifications
- Use website blockers (Freedom, Cold Turkey)
- Wear headphones (even if not playing music)
- Close all browser tabs except documentation

**3. Create Transition Rituals**

**Start ritual (3-5 minutes):**
- Review what you're working on
- Get coffee/water
- Put phone in drawer
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Set timer for 90 minutes

**End ritual (3-5 minutes):**
- Document progress
- Note where to pick up next
- Clear workspace
- Stretch

### The 90-Minute Rule

Research shows cognitive performance peaks during 90-minute cycles. After 90 minutes:
- Focus degrades
- Error rates increase
- Creativity declines

**Structure:**
- 90 minutes focused work
- 15 minute break (walk, stretch, not screens)
- Repeat 2-3 times per day maximum

Don't try to do 4+ deep work sessions daily. You'll burn out.

## Part 2: Energy Management

### The Four Energy Types

You have four types of energy that matter:

**1. Physical Energy**
- Sleep (non-negotiable 7-9 hours)
- Exercise (30 min daily minimum)
- Nutrition (protein + healthy fats, less sugar)
- Hydration (2-3 liters water daily)

**2. Emotional Energy**
- Relationships (connection vs. isolation)
- Stress management (meditation, therapy, hobbies)
- Boundaries (saying no)

**3. Mental Energy**
- Novel problem solving (uses most)
- Routine coding (uses moderate)
- Meetings (often depleting)
- Admin tasks (low usage)

**4. Spiritual Energy**
- Purpose (why you're doing this)
- Values alignment (are you building what matters?)
- Growth (learning vs. stagnation)

### Energy Audit Exercise

For one week, track your energy levels hourly (1-10 scale). Notice:
- When is energy highest?
- What activities drain you?
- What recharges you?

Then **schedule your hardest problems during peak energy hours.**

Most developers are most alert 2-4 hours after waking. Use this for complex problem solving, not email.

## Part 3: Task Management for Developers

### The Eisenhower Matrix for Code

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Production bugs<br>Demos<br>Deadlines | Architecture<br>Refactoring<br>Learning<br>Documentation |
| **Not Important** | Most meetings<br>Some emails<br>Interruptions | Busy work<br>Premature optimization<br>Bikeshedding |

**Where developers waste time:**
- "Not Important/Not Urgent" - Endless refactoring, reading HackerNews
- "Not Important/Urgent" - Meetings that could be emails

**Where you should spend 60%+ of your time:**
- "Important/Not Urgent" - This is where career growth happens

### The Single Most Important Task (SMIT)

Every morning, before checking email/Slack:

1. Write down: "What's the ONE thing I can do today that would make everything else easier or unnecessary?"
2. Do that first
3. Everything else is bonus

This alone can 2x your productivity.

### Task Batching

**Batch similar tasks together:**
- **Code review** - Review all PRs in one 30-60 min block
- **Email** - Check 2-3 times daily max (morning, noon, end of day)
- **Meetings** - Group on certain days if possible
- **Admin** - Friday afternoons

Why? Context switching kills productivity. Every switch costs 10-20 minutes of refocus time.

## Part 4: Tools and Environment

### Essential Productivity Tools

**Code Editor Mastery:**
- Learn keyboard shortcuts deeply (see our [Keyboard Shortcuts Guide](#/blog/keyboard-shortcuts-developers))
- Use snippets for boilerplate
- Master multi-cursor editing
- Set up project-specific configs

Practice shortcuts in [BrokeCoder](#/play) to build muscle memory.

**Version Control:**
- Commit often with good messages
- Use branches for features
- Learn Git CLI (GUI is slower)
- Set up useful aliases

Full guide: [Git and GitHub for Beginners](#/blog/git-github-beginners)

**Terminal:**
- Learn bash/zsh basics
- Set up aliases for common commands
- Use tmux or screen for sessions
- Master tab completion

**Project Management:**
- Use GitHub Issues/Projects
- Or Linear, Jira, Asana (pick one, master it)
- Keep a personal task list separate
- Review weekly

### Environment Optimization

**Physical Setup:**
- External monitor (minimum 24", ideally 27"+)
- Mechanical keyboard (better tactile feedback)
- Ergonomic chair (you sit 6-10 hours daily)
- Standing desk option
- Good lighting (reduce eye strain)

**Digital Setup:**
- Clean desktop (zero icons)
- Organized file system
- Project templates
- Dotfiles in version control
- Automated backups

**Workspace:**
- Dedicated work area if remote
- Visual boundary (helps brain switch modes)
- Minimal distractions
- Comfortable temperature

## Part 5: Communication Efficiency

### The Communication Matrix

| | Use When | Tools |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **Sync** | Urgent, Complex, Collaborative | Zoom, Phone, In-person |
| **Async** | Most things, Documentation, Updates | Email, Slack, PRs, Docs |

**Default to async.** Your maker schedule matters more than their manager schedule.

### Writing Better Messages

**Bad Slack message:**
"Hey, got a minute?"

**Good Slack message:**
"Need help with API auth bug. Tried X and Y, getting error Z. Can you look at PR #123 when you have 15 min? Not urgent - EOD is fine."

**Why it's better:**
- Context included
- Clear ask
- Time estimate
- Urgency level
- No round-trips

### Meeting Efficiency

**Before accepting any meeting:**
- Is there an agenda?
- Am I needed, or just invited?
- Could this be an email/doc?
- What's my role? (Decide, Input, Inform)

**If you organize meetings:**
- Always have agenda
- Start/end on time
- Take notes
- Send action items after
- Invite minimum people necessary

**Meeting time audit:** Track all meetings for 2 weeks. You'll be horrified. Decline 30% of them next month.

## Part 6: Learning Efficiency

### The Learning Paradox

Developers need to constantly learn, but learning takes time away from delivering. The key is **strategic learning.**

**High-ROI Learning:**
- Fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, system design)
- Technologies used at your job
- Adjacent skills (one frontend, one backend skill)
- Communication and leadership

**Low-ROI Learning:**
- Flavor-of-the-week frameworks
- Technologies you'll never use
- Over-specialized niche topics
- Tutorial hell (watching without doing)

### The 15-Minute Learning Rule

Spend 15 minutes daily learning something new:
- Read one technical blog post
- Solve one coding challenge
- Watch one conference talk
- Read documentation for a new library

**Why 15 minutes?**
- Sustainable daily
- No excuse to skip
- Compounds over time
- 91 hours per year of learning

**Track it.** Use a simple log or GitHub streak.

### Applied Learning

**Don't just consume—create:**
- Build a project with the new tool
- Write a blog post explaining it
- Teach it to someone
- Add to your portfolio

Learning by doing is 10x more effective than passive consumption.

## Part 7: Code Productivity

### Writing Better Code Faster

**1. Plan Before You Code**

5 minutes planning saves 50 minutes debugging.

Before writing code:
- What's the input?
- What's the output?
- What are edge cases?
- What's the simplest solution?

**2. Test as You Go**

Don't write 200 lines then test. Write 10-20 lines, test, repeat.

**3. Use TypeScript**

Type safety catches bugs at compile time, not runtime. Initial slowdown, massive speedup over time.

See our [TypeScript Fundamentals](#/skills/typescript-fundamentals) guide.

**4. Write Tests (Eventually)**

Not for everything, but for:
- Complex logic
- Edge cases
- Critical paths
- Bugs (regression prevention)

Learn more: [Testing with Jest and React](#/skills/testing-jest-react)

**5. Refactor Ruthlessly**

When you notice code smell:
- Confusing logic
- Duplication
- Long functions
- Poor naming

Refactor immediately. Future you will thank you.

**6. Use Linters and Formatters**

- ESLint for catching bugs
- Prettier for formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks

Never manually format code again.

### Debugging Efficiency

**Systematic Debugging:**
1. Reproduce the bug consistently
2. Isolate the problem (binary search)
3. Form hypothesis
4. Test hypothesis
5. Fix and verify
6. Document the lesson

**Rubber Duck Debugging:**

Explain the problem out loud to an inanimate object. Seriously. It works.

Why? Verbalizing forces you to clarify your thinking and often reveals the issue.

## Part 8: Avoiding Burnout

High productivity is worthless if it leads to burnout. Sustainable productivity requires balance.

**Warning signs:**
- Dreading work
- Physical symptoms (headaches, insomnia)
- Cynicism
- Reduced performance
- Emotional exhaustion

Read our full [Developer Burnout Guide](#/blog/avoid-developer-burnout) for prevention and recovery strategies.

**Prevention:**
- Take regular breaks (actually take them)
- Use all your vacation days
- Have hobbies outside coding
- Maintain relationships
- Exercise regularly
- Sleep 7-9 hours
- Say no to overwork

**Recovery:**
- Take time off (not optional)
- Talk to someone (friend, therapist)
- Reduce workload temporarily
- Re-evaluate priorities
- Consider job change if toxic environment

## Part 9: Productivity Metrics

### What to Measure

**Good metrics:**
- Hours of deep work per week
- Projects shipped per quarter
- Learning hours per week
- Energy levels (subjective but useful)

**Bad metrics:**
- Lines of code written
- Commits per day
- Hours worked
- Emails sent

**Focus on outcomes, not output.**

### Weekly Review Process

Every Friday (30 minutes):
1. **Review accomplishments** - What shipped?
2. **Review blockers** - What slowed you down?
3. **Review energy** - When were you most/least productive?
4. **Plan next week** - Top 3 priorities
5. **Celebrate wins** - Acknowledge progress

This single habit compounds dramatically over time.

## Part 10: Advanced Strategies

### Themed Days

**Monday:** Planning, architecture, system design
**Tuesday:** Deep coding
**Wednesday:** Meetings, collaboration, code review
**Thursday:** Deep coding
**Friday:** Learning, documentation, cleanup

Not all days will follow this, but having themes helps.

### The Two-List Strategy

**List 1: Top 5 Career Goals**

Things that will advance your career:
- Ship project X
- Learn skill Y
- Get promoted
- Build side project
- Speak at conference

**List 2: Everything Else**

Everything that didn't make List 1.

**The rule:** Work on List 1 ONLY. Avoid List 2 at all costs—those are distractions disguised as opportunities.

### Automation

Automate anything you do more than 3 times:
- Deployment scripts
- Testing scripts
- Code generation
- Environment setup
- Data migrations

Time investment up front, massive time savings later.

### Delegation and Asking for Help

**When to ask for help:**
- After 30-60 minutes stuck
- When someone else is expert
- When it's blocking you

**How to ask:**
- Show what you've tried
- Include error messages
- Link to relevant code
- Ask specific questions

**When to delegate:**
- Someone else can do it 70%+ as well
- It's not core to your role
- It's a learning opportunity for junior devs

## Productivity Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Productivity Theater

Looking busy instead of being effective:
- Responding to Slack immediately
- Attending all meetings
- Working long hours
- Answering every email quickly

### Premature Optimization

Spending 4 hours optimizing code that runs once per day. Ask: **Is this the best use of my time right now?**

### Perfectionism

Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship working code, iterate later.

### Comparison Trap

Comparing your productivity to others is useless. People have different:
- Experience levels
- Contexts
- Responsibilities
- Energy levels
- Life situations

**Compare yourself to yourself last month**, not to the 10x dev on Twitter.

## Your Productivity Stack

**Morning (2-3 hours):**
- Deep work block #1
- Hardest problem of the day
- No meetings, no distractions

**Midday (2-3 hours):**
- Meetings and collaboration
- Code reviews
- Team communication
- Lunch break

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):**
- Deep work block #2 (if energy allows)
- Or admin, learning, documentation
- Lower cognitive load tasks

**Evening:**
- Sign off completely
- No work email/Slack
- Recharge for tomorrow

## The 80/20 of Developer Productivity

**20% of actions that give 80% of results:**

1. **Deep work blocks** - 2+ hours daily uninterrupted
2. **Single most important task** - Do it first
3. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Save hours weekly ([learn them](#/blog/keyboard-shortcuts-developers))
4. **Async communication** - Protect your time
5. **Weekly reviews** - Continuous improvement
6. **Saying no** - To non-essential work
7. **Sleep** - Non-negotiable 7-9 hours
8. **Automation** - For repeated tasks

Start with these. Master them. Then add more.
