# Elite Digital Agency Roadmap (AdSense Monetization)

Objective: Achieve $10,000+ annual AdSense revenue in 12 months using Google-compliant, scalable methods.

Success Milestones:
- Month 6: 25,000+ organic sessions/month
- Month 9: 2.5+ min average session duration
- Month 12: 2.8+ pages/session
- Ongoing: Zero AdSense policy violations

Operational Principles:
- Human-centric design; value first, monetization second
- Algorithmic alignment via exceptional UX
- Engagement architecture: increase dwell time and page depth
- Compliance-first; no gray-hat tactics
- Compounding value via evergreen content systems

Team Roles & Recommendations:
- Digital Strategy Director: Approves AdSense-focused content verticals (Typing Mastery, JavaScript, Tech Careers, Devices, Game Guides). Owns P&L projections; target RPM $15–$30 via content mix and viewability.
- SEO Expert (AdSense-Focused): Build semantic topic clusters and internal linking (hub-and-spoke). Prioritize high-intent informational queries; enforce on-page schema and fast CWV.
- Growth Marketer: Design acquisition funnels (content → hubs → play) and partner backlinks (white-hat). Launch content refresh cadence.
- UX/UI Designer: Mobile-first responsive, progressive load, and explore modules to reduce dead ends and drive 5+ links/page.
- Full-Stack Developer: Maintain hash router, add hubs, and engagement "Explore More" component. Keep CWV 90+ mobile; lazy assets.
- Content Strategist: 100-article roadmap; publish 20 in Phase 1. Each piece links to 3+ related topics and hubs.
- CRO Specialist: Density calibration and ad viewability heatmapping. Keep non-intrusive UX; test in-article and in-feed units later.
- Data & Analytics Specialist: Define KPIs (sessions, dwell, pages/session, RPM, viewability). Monthly reviews and quarterly pivots.

Deliverables by Phase:
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Niche Selection Matrix and Business Model Blueprint
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3–4): Site IA with hubs; internal linking logic; CWV optimizations
- Phase 3 (Weeks 5–8): Editorial calendar (100 articles); SEO roadmap; publish first 20 outlines
- Phase 4 (Weeks 9–12): Monetization playbook; baseline metrics and optimization schedule
- Phase 5 (Months 4–12): Growth & Scaling; quarterly reports and attribution modeling

Decision Protocol:
- Increases long-term engagement?
- Aligns with Google quality guidelines?
- Scales without linear cost?
- Compounds value over time?
- Proud to present to AdSense team?

Notes:
- This roadmap is implemented with code changes: hub pages, explore modules, and safe placeholders for ad slots (disabled by default). See `routes.js`, `app.js`, and `index.html`.
