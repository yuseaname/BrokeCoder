# SEO Roadmap (AdSense-Focused)

Strategy:
- Semantic clusters: Typing, JavaScript, Careers, Devices, Game Guides
- Hub-and-spoke IA: New hubs wired and linked sitewide
- Internal linking: 5–6+ destinations per page via `Explore More`
- Structured data: BlogPosting, FAQ, VideoGame, WebSite (hubs)
- On-page: Descriptive titles, meta, headings; accessible markup

Technical:
- Router: Hash-based friendly URLs; dynamic slug handling
- CWV: Aim 90+ mobile; lazy images; minimal scripts; consent-gated analytics
- Sitemap/robots: Keep existing; add hub routes if needed later

Execution:
- Publish 100-article calendar over 18 months
- Each article: maps search intent and links to ≥3 related topics + hub
- Quarterly refresh: update facts, add links, improve headings

Measurement:
- Month 6: 25k sessions; Month 9: 2.5-min avg; Month 12: 2.8 pages/session
- Monitor internal link click-through and scroll depth

Notes:
- No gray-hat tactics; sustainability over shortcuts
