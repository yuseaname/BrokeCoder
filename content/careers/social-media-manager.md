# Social Media Manager

One-line hook: Build online presence that drives awareness, engagement, and revenue—without guesswork.

## What You Do
You plan and run social media for brands. You turn business goals into content calendars, produce posts, manage community interactions, and report results.

## Day in the Life
- Morning: review metrics, reply to comments/DMs, confirm today’s posts
- Midday: produce assets (videos, carousels), write captions, schedule posts
- Afternoon: community engagement, trend review, iterate hooks and thumbnails
- Weekly: update calendar, build KPI report, propose experiments for next week

### Daily Work
- Create content (short-form video, carousels, threads, images)
- Plan editorial calendars and campaign schedules
- Manage comments, DMs, and community conversations
- Track metrics (reach, engagement rate, watch time, CTR)
- Collaborate with marketing, product, and support teams
- Experiment and iterate based on data, not vibes

### Deliverables
- Platform strategy and brand voice guide
- Monthly content calendar with asset list
- Post copy + assets (video, images, carousels)
- KPI report and insights (what worked, what to improve)

Extended deliverables:
- Hook library and swipe file
- Thumbnail and cover templates
- Moderation SOPs and response scripts
- Crisis communication plan and escalation paths
- UGC briefing template for collaborators

## Who This Is Good For
- Creators who like content + community
- Organized communicators who enjoy routine and iteration
- People comfortable with analytics and business goals

## Skills You Need
### Hard Skills
- Platform expertise: TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, X
- Content frameworks: hooks, storytelling, CTAs
- Basic design/video editing (Canva, CapCut, Premiere)
- Analytics: reach, ER, watch time, retention, CTR
- Basic copywriting, brand voice, tone consistency
- Social listening, community moderation

### Soft Skills
- Communication and context gathering
- Emotional intelligence, calm under pressure
- Process design (calendar, asset pipeline, review cycles)
- Adaptability: trend spotting, fast iteration

## Tools You’ll Use
- Scheduling: Buffer, Hootsuite, Later
- Creation: Canva, CapCut, Descript, Figma
- Analytics: native platform dashboards, Notion/Sheets
- Asset storage: Google Drive, Notion, Air

Tip: a shared calendar + asset checklist reduces errors and missed posts.

## Learning Roadmap (0–90 Days)
### 0–30 Days (Foundation)
- Pick two platforms (e.g., Instagram + TikTok)
- Study 30 winning accounts in one niche; document patterns
- Build a 4-week content calendar for a hypothetical brand
- Create 20 posts: 8 short-form videos, 8 carousels, 4 threads
- Track metrics in a simple dashboard

### 30–60 Days (Portfolio + Systems)
- Create an editorial process with templates (brief, asset, caption)
- Publish daily for 30 days on your personal brand or a test brand
- Produce a KPI report: wins, misses, next-step hypotheses
- Build a case study PDF (screenshots + metrics)

### 60–90 Days (Client-Ready)
- Offer a trial package to 2 local businesses or creators
- Deliver content calendar + 20 posts + KPI report
- Collect testimonial and permission to share results

Add one experiment: hooks + thumbnail A/B, then publish lessons.

## Portfolio Projects (Pick 3–5)
- 30-Day Content Sprint: one brand, ≥30 posts, KPI summary
- Platform Playbook: voice, pillar topics, content patterns
- Growth experiment: hooks/CTAs A/B test with results
- Crisis response plan: moderation SOPs, response templates
- “Turnaround” case study: low-engagement to consistent performance

Acceptance criteria examples:
- Sprint: post daily; increase reach/ER; show retention gains for video
- Playbook: clear pillars; reusable caption formulas; brand voice samples
- A/B test: document variants and metrics (hook, thumbnail, length)

## How to Get Your First Client/Job
1. Pick a niche you understand (fitness, local coffee, creators)
2. Create 3 micro case studies (fake or real) with assets + metrics
3. Email/DM 30 targets with a helpful audit (no pitch-first)
4. Offer a 30-day starter package (calendar + 20 posts + report)
5. Ask for testimonial + permission to share metrics
6. Upsell to monthly retainer (content + moderation + reporting)

### Outreach Scripts
1. "Your content cadence is irregular—reach drops. I built a 30‑day calendar with hooks and thumbnails. Want a free audit?"
2. "Comments are unanswered—community is a growth driver. I can add moderation blocks and response SOPs."
3. "Your first 3 seconds don’t land—hooks need clarity. I have a set of variants to test quickly."
4. "Thumbnails and covers are inconsistent—brand trust suffers. I can ship a template pack tomorrow."

## Pricing & Salary Ranges (No Guarantees)
- Employment: $40k–$70k entry-level; mid-level $60k–$90k

- Productized services: $299–$999 starter packs (defined deliverables)

- Freelance retainers: monthly content + moderation + reporting
- Project packs: campaign assets and calendar for a launch

## Common Mistakes & Fixes
- Posting without a goal → Define KPI, campaign objective, and CTA
- “Viral-only” mindset → Chase consistency; optimize retention and watch time
- No asset pipeline → Build templates and a content calendar workflow
- Ignoring comments → Community drives reach; schedule moderation blocks
- Shaky analytics → Track weekly; iterate on hooks and thumbnails

Additional:
- Trend-chasing without relevance → Align content to brand goals
- Over-posting sales → Maintain goodwill: value 70%, promo 30%

## FAQs
- How many platforms should I manage? Start with 1–2, master cadence.
- Do I need pro editing skills? No—solid hooks + clean cuts beat fancy effects.
- What matters most for growth? Strong hooks, retention, and consistency.
- How do I price? Base on scope: platforms, post volume, moderation, reporting.
- Can I get results fast? You can learn fast; results take iteration and time.
- How many posts per week? Start with 3–5/platform; adjust by performance.
- Should I repost across platforms? Adapt formats—don’t blindly repost.
