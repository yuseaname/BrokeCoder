# Web Designer (No-Code / WordPress)

Hook: Build simple, fast, and trustworthy websites—no complex code required.

## What You Do
You design and ship websites with no-code builders and WordPress. You structure pages, map user journeys, and make content clear.

## Day in the Life
A typical week mixes planning, building, and polishing:
- Monday: Brief call, sitemap updates, wireframes for new pages
- Tuesday: Build sections in your chosen builder (headers, hero, services)
- Wednesday: Content pass—clarify copy, add visuals, set internal links
- Thursday: Performance and a11y—Lighthouse checks, image compression, aria labels
- Friday: Client review, revisions, and publish; prepare handoff docs

Cadence matters more than heroics—ship small wins every day, keep sites clean and reliable.

### Daily Work
- Create wireframes and page layouts
- Design in Figma or build directly in a page builder
- Implement content, forms, and basic SEO
- Test speed, mobile, and accessibility

### Deliverables
- Site map and wireframes
- Page templates and component library (buttons, cards, sections)
- Pages: home, services, about, contact, blog, FAQ, pricing
- Forms (contact, bookings) with error and success states
- Basic SEO + performance checklist (titles, meta, headings, speed)
- Accessibility checklist (contrast, landmarks, keyboard nav)
- CMS structure: collections, fields, and editorial SOPs
- Redirects and URL strategy (clean slugs, canonical decisions)
- Hosting and backups plan
- Handoff docs (how to edit content, update menus, post blogs)

## Who This Is Good For
- Visual thinkers who enjoy clarity and structure
- Builders who like tangible deliverables and client impact

## Skills You Need
### Hard Skills
- UX basics, page hierarchy, and scannability
- WordPress + page builders (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg)
- No-code tools: Webflow, Framer, Squarespace
- Basic SEO and accessibility

### Soft Skills
- Client communication and expectation-setting
- Project scoping and timelines
- Iteration and feedback cycles

## Tools You’ll Use
- Figma for design; WordPress/Webflow for build
- Plugins: forms, caching, SEO
- Analytics: GA4, Search Console

Pro tip: specialize in one stack (e.g., Webflow + Figma or WordPress + Elementor). Depth beats breadth for speed and quality.

## Learning Roadmap (0–90 Days)
### 0–30 Days (Foundation)
- Study 30 clean sites in one niche
- Build wireframes and component library
- Rebuild 3 homepages in Webflow or WordPress

### 30–60 Days (Portfolio + Systems)
- Ship a simple 4-page site for a local brand
- Create a reusable starter theme/template
- Publish case study (before → after)

### 60–90 Days (Client-Ready)
- Offer a “Starter Site” productized service
- Ship 2 sites and collect testimonials
- Iterate your process and pricing

Add one advanced project: a speed/a11y pass with measurable improvements (LCP < 2.5s, keyboard-friendly nav, clear focus states).

## Portfolio Projects (3–6)
- Starter site (home, services, contact, blog)
- UX overhaul with improved metrics
- Component library + style guide
- Performance optimization case study

Acceptance criteria examples:
- Starter site: mobile-first, passes basic a11y checks, loads under 2.5s LCP
- UX overhaul: new hierarchy improves click-through to services by 20%+
- Components: documented variants (primary/secondary buttons, cards, CTAs)
- Performance case study: images optimized, unused scripts removed, caching configured

## How to Get Your First Client/Job
1. Build a demo site for a niche (e.g., barbers, clinics)
2. Email 30 prospects with a helpful audit
3. Offer a fixed-price starter site
4. Deliver in 7–14 days; ask for testimonials

### Outreach Scripts (copy, personalize lightly)
1. "Noticed your site loads slowly on mobile. I ran a quick check—images and caching are the main culprits. Want a 10‑point improvement plan?"
2. "Your Services page hides your best offers below the fold. I rebuilt a sample hero + CTA—happy to share a mockup."
3. "Navigation feels crowded. A simpler header improves conversion. I can ship a Starter Site in 10–14 days—fixed price, clear scope."
4. "Contact form returns a generic message—many users bounce. I propose a clearer success state + FAQ."
5. "If you’re considering WordPress → Webflow, I can migrate and keep SEO intact (redirects, metadata, internal links)."

## Pricing & Salary Ranges (No Guarantees)
- Employment: $45k–$80k entry; $65k–$100k mid-level
- Freelance sites: $1,000–$6,000 starter; $6,000–$15,000 advanced
- Productized: $999–$2,999 fixed-scope starter sites

> Disclaimer: Income depends on scope, niche, and proof of clean delivery. No guarantees.

## How You Get Paid
- Employment: salary + benefits; ship projects as part of a team
- Freelance: fixed-price sites; keep scope tight (pages, features, revisions)
- Retainers: monthly improvements (speed, a11y, content updates)
- Productized services: standardized Starter Site or Speed/A11y package

Publish transparent case studies—before/after screenshots, Lighthouse metrics, and a checklist of shipped improvements.

## Common Mistakes & Fixes
- Pretty but confusing → Clarify hierarchy; improve copy and CTAs
- Slow sites → Use caching, image optimization, lean plugins
- Messy themes → Create a starter template; document settings

Additional fixes:
- Unclear CTAs → One primary action per page; supporting links secondary
- Heavy animations → Prioritize motion with purpose; respect user’s reduced motion setting
- Plugin sprawl → Audit quarterly; remove unused assets; prefer native features

## FAQs
- Do I need coding? Minimal—no-code tools cover most needs.
- Which platform is best? Pick one; specialize.
- How do I price? Fixed scope + clear deliverables works well.
- Do I need SEO expertise? Basic on-page + clean structure is enough to start.
- Can I maintain sites? Yes—offer monthly retainers with defined tasks.
- How many revisions? Set limits (e.g., two rounds) to keep timing predictable.
