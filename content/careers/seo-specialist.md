# SEO Specialist

Hook: Make sites easy to find and fast to use—helpful-first SEO.

## What You Do
You improve organic visibility: fix technical issues, plan content strategy, and build topical authority.

## Day in the Life
- Morning: crawl the site, check Search Console, review new indexation issues
- Midday: brief writers on new topics, update internal links, ship schema
- Afternoon: fix technical tasks (redirects, canonicals, sitemaps), sync with devs
- Weekly cadence: report movements (rankings, CTR), propose 3 next experiments

Your job is compounding—small fixes done consistently beat one-off “hacks.”

### Daily Work
- Run audits (crawl, indexing, speed, mobile, internal links)
- Map keywords and plan topic clusters
- Collaborate with writers and developers
- Track performance (rankings, CTR, conversions)
- Suggest technical fixes and content updates

### Deliverables
- SEO audit + prioritized roadmap
- Keyword map + content plan
- On-page optimization checklist
- Internal linking plan + schema recommendations

Advanced deliverables:
- Core Web Vitals improvement plan (images, scripts, caching)
- Redirect strategy and URL consolidation
- Topic cluster map with hub pages
- FAQ + HowTo schema opportunities

## Who This Is Good For

- Writers/developers who enjoy pragmatic optimization

## Skills You Need

## Learning Roadmap (0–90 Days)
### 0–30 Days (Foundation)

### 60–90 Days (Client-Ready)
- Pitch 20 businesses with mini audits
- Offer a pilot: audit + fixes + content plan
- Publish case study with measurable improvements

Add one cluster build: ship a pillar page + 4 support posts, interlink properly, and add schema. Track clicks and impressions.

## Portfolio Projects (3–6)

2. "Your blog posts don’t cross-link; you’re losing topical authority. I mapped a cluster—happy to share a mini plan."
3. "Core Web Vitals fail on mobile (LCP 4.2s). I have a speed plan—images + caching + script order."
4. "Search Console shows duplicate titles. Let’s fix templates and improve CTR—low effort, noticeable gains."
